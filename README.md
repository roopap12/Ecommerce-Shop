*  Test components and their interactions.
*  Deployment:
*  Choose a deployment platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS,  Vercel).
*  Prepare for deployment (environment variables, build process).
*  Throughout the process, as you create and modify components, keep track of your changes with Git:
*  git add . to stage changes

### git commit -m "Description of changes" to commit changes
### git push to upload changes to GitHub

### This gives a structured sequence for development   while ensuring you cover all components and functionalities planned for your MVP. 
### Remember to test individual components as you create them to minimize bugs in the final integration.
